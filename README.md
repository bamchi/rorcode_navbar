The topic of today's video is the process of implementing a responsive NavigationBar with Stimulus.js.

One of the strengths of TailwindCSS is that you can easily get UI components.

We will use the sample code from [https://tailwindui.com](https://tailwindui.com) or [https://tailwindcomponents.com](https://tailwindcomponents.com) as it is.

The function of opening and closing the menu will be implemented through stimulus.js. It's not fun to just open and close, so I'll implement a simple animation.

It is an example that can be used for commercial services, so please refer to it.

The navigation bar example used in this repository can be found at this [[link]](https://tailwindui.com/components/marketing/elements/headers).
